# Ray's basic Python project 
 
Hello! I’m a beginner coder who primarily uses Python.
I enjoy learning by creating various practice scripts and small projects as a hobby.

This repository contains the code I’ve written while practicing.
Each script includes brief comments explaining what it does. I’m still at a beginner level, so any feedback or suggestions on my code would be greatly appreciated.
If you encounter any issues while running the code, please feel free to let me know.
